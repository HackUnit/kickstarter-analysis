# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.
---
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends to assist a made up lady named Louise in figuring out if it's really worth it to produce a play on her own.

* Louise, you probably should just tone down on the Kickstarter goal amount by over half of what you want, and honestly just do this in the Great Britain market before you try the US market. Start small, then go big when you can.
